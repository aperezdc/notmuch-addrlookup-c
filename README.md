# Notmuch Address Lookup tool — in C

This is an address lookup tool similar to the `addrlookup` one found
in the (apparently unmaintained) [Vala Notmuch
binding](https://github.com/spaetz/vala-notmuch), using the
[Notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org) database as source.

The one and only feature is accepting a string as first argument, and it
will use the Notmuch database to output the names and e-mail addresses of
the people you have exchanged e-mails with, most used ones first. This
works neatly as [address completer for the Notmuch Emacs
interface](http://notmuchmail.org/emacstips/#index15h2).

One more thing: I plan to keep the tool up-to-date when new Notmuch
releases change the API of the library. Precisely the reasons why
this small project was started are:

* The [Go](http://golang.org) implementation included with Notmuch
  insists in outputting all the text in lowercase. Plus, requires
  a working Go development setup to build it.
- There used to be similar tools included with Notmuch, written in Vala
  and Python, but they have been removed due to lack of maintenance.


## `notmuch address`

Starting with version 0.19 a new `notmuch address` subcommand is available,
which can be used to search for e-mail addresses as well. While similar,
`notmuch-addrlookup-c` may still be preferred because:

- The output format can be set to Mutt-compatible, which many existing tools
  know how to handle.

- It automatically searches for addresses in the `To:`, `Cc:`, `Bcc:`, and
  `From:` message headers, and sorts them out by most frequently seen.
  This usually renders more relevant results.


## Building

Make sure you have the following installed, plus their development
packages:

* `libnotmuch` — Included with Notmuch.
* GLib — It is a dependency of Notmuch as well.
* `pkg-config`
* GNU Make and a working C compiler.

Then just build and install it:
```sh
make
sudo cp notmuch-addrlookup /usr/local/bin
```

## Using

You can check that the program works by invoking from a shell. The
only argument it takes is a string, which is searched for in the
e-mail addresses contained in the headers of the messages indexed
by Notmuch. Example output (names and addresses are not real):

```
% notmuch-addrlookup peter
Peter Jones <peter@jonesfamily.com>
John Peters <john.peters@gmail.com>
Peter Tosh <gimmesome@reggaemusic.net>
Noren Petersen <norenp@no.se>
%
```

### Vim

The plug-in [vim-notmuch-addrlookup](https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-notmuch-addrlookup) adds completion of e-mail addresses via `notmuch-addrlookup-c` (by default by hitting `<Ctrl-X><Ctrl-O>`) when composing an e-mail.

### Emacs UI

The Emacs Notmuch UI
[can be configured](http://notmuchmail.org/emacstips/#index13h2)
to use the tool for completing addresses when composing.

### Mutt

The [Mutt UA](http://www.mutt.org/) can be configured to use
`notmuch-addrlookup` by setting the following options:

```
set query_command="notmuch-addrlookup --mutt '%s'"
```

### alot

The [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot) MUA can be configured to use
`notmuch-addrlookup`, using an `[accounts]` section in the configuration
file similar to this:

```
[accounts]
  [[youraccountname]]
    realname = Your Name
    address = your@address.com
    ...
    [[[abook]]]
      type = shellcommand
      regexp = '^(?P<email>[^@]+@[^\t]+)\t+(?P<name>[^\t]+)'
      command = notmuch-addrlookup --mutt
      ignorecase = True
```
